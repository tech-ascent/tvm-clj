    Normally buffer is created automatically during lower and build.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : tuple of Expr
        The shape of the buffer.

    dtype : str, optional
        The data type of the buffer.

    name : str, optional
        The name of the buffer.

    data : Var, optional
        The data pointer in the buffer.

    strides: array of Expr
        The stride of the buffer.

    elem_offset: Expr, optional
        The beginning offset of the array to data.
        In terms of number of elements of dtype.

    scope: str, optional
        The storage scope of the buffer, if not global.
        If scope equals empty string, it means it is global memory.

    data_alignment: int, optional
        The alignment of data pointer in bytes.
        If -1 is passed, the alignment will be set to TVM's internal default.

    --CN - REMOVED - No one understands what this does.  It is only referenced in the code
in order to perform a check during argument binding.  So the description below is accurate
for what it is worth but it is hard to me to see how this is useful.


    offset_factor: int, optional
        The factor of elem_offset field, when set,
        elem_offset is required to be multiple of offset_factor.
        If 0 is pssed, the alignment will be set to 1.
        if non-zero is passed, we will created a Var for elem_offset if elem_offset is not None.

    Returns

        The created buffer

    Note
    ----
    Buffer data structure reflects the DLTensor structure in dlpack.
    While DLTensor data structure is very general, it is usually helpful
    to create function that only handles specific case of data structure
    and make compiled function benefit from it.

    If user pass strides and elem_offset is passed as None
    when constructing the function, then the function will be specialized
    for the DLTensor that is compact and aligned.
    If user pass a fully generic symbolic array to the strides,
    then the resulting function becomes fully generic."
